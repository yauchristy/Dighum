Code and excel file of data used to create bar charts of financial burden on patients across income levels and ethnic groups due to health insurance claim denials. 
The claim_denial_financial_resp file was used to create bar charts of percentage of denied claims and median amount of OOP costs across income levels and race/ethnic groups. The figures on race/ethnic groups were created using Flourish and the figures on income level were created using R Shiny App (code in R file). The KFF file was used to create the table of denial rates across health plan metal levels.
